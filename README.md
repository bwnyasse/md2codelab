# md2codelab
Inspired by [googlecodelabs](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/), this repository provides another simple tool to convert a markdown file to a complete codelab

The generated codelabs are interactive instructional tutorials, which can be authored in markdown format
using some extra add-ons. This repo contains all the tools and documentation you'll need
for building your own codelabs.

See the [extra/ui] directory for detailed description about the generated entry page.

## What is this ?

This project is completely inspired by [googlecodelabs](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/). 
My personnal experience with the provided [tool](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools) by Google was not enough to 
customize my generated codelab. And as far I was using their tool , I've faced a lot of
bugs while parsing markdown file to codelab html. 

Writing this tool, the goal was to provide another tool that supports all the features 
avalaible in markdown. And a complete entry point, to display all the codelabs as provide
by this [google page](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/)
